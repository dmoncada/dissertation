# Dissertation

Here you can find the LaTeX template that I've prepared for my dissertation, as
well as some tools for automating the building process of the document from the
CLI.

The template is written cleanly enough for anyone to pick it up. Also, I've
tried to keep everything tidy in their own folder.

Use `make refs` for running the script that prepares the references to be used
in the document, `make diss` for building the document in PDF format, or `make
all` for both.

Go right ahead and give it a try it!
